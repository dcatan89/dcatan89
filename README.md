### About Me 👀
<hr>
Im Daniel Catan, however I go by DJ and Im a recent bootcamp graduate looking to be part of a team as a software developer. I know React, JavaScript, CSS3, HTML, NODE.js, Express, PostgresQL and still have tons to learn and explore. 

I am eager to learn and try to stop myself from having shiny object syndrome when it comes to new technologies... for the most part. I continue to expand my understanding everyday hoping to gain something new or solidify what I know.

Besides Coding, I like to dance (choreography)💃 play basketball⛹🏽‍♂️, and exercise🏋️. You can either catch me at the gym or the coffee shop.
