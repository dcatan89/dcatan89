### About Me 👀
<hr>
  
Im Daniel Catan, however I go by DJ and Im a recent bootcamp graduate looking to be part of a team as a software developer.  
I know React, JavaScript, CSS3, HTML, NODE.js, Express, PostgresQL and still have tons to learn and explore.  

  
I would say I am eager to learn as I am always thinking of what new technologies I can implement in my projects. I continue to expand my understanding everyday hoping to gain something new or solidify what I know.  
  
Besides Coding, I like to dance (choreography)💃 , play basketball⛹🏽‍♂️, or exercise🏋️. You can either catch me at the gym or the coffee shop.
